## Description

This React-based Google Books Search application queries and display books based on user searches. This application was also built with Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.

## View

## Usage

The user can search for books via the Google Books API and render them under the Search tab. The user has the option to view a book by clicking on the book's title, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Save" a book, saving it to the Mongo database.

The Saved page renders all books saved to the Mongo database. Again, the user has the option to view a book by clicking on the book's title, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Delete" a book, removing it from the Mongo database.
